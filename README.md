# hello-world
Hello world, here is a small program I built to test out GitHub.
I'm Jezuel, currently 20 years old. I am ambitious and I enjoy accomplishing my goals.
I'm here because I want to keep developing my analytical skills and learn some useful hard skills that are future proof.
Other than that I have many interests, but I'd rather not write an essay about it right now.
